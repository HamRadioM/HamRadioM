I shoot 35mm and medium-format film photography (and some digital too). You can see more of my work on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/wming72). 

I develop and scan most of my films. I also use my small co-developed python tool [NegativeFilmProcessor](https://github.com/HamRadioM/NegativeFilmProcessor) to preview negative conversions.
